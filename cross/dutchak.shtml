Hi guys!
</P>
<p class="abzac">I was asked to write a story about my being and studying in Groningen, the Netherlands. </P>

<p class="abzac">I feel very sorry for writing in English, but I have no possibility to type it in a different way at the moment.</P>

<p class="abzac">I started Lyceum like every one of you passing the entrance exams. My choice was Ph&M department and I was quite a success in those subjects. Therefore, I thought I'd never look into something else, but I tried to look at all the possible chances that baffled me totally. Where shall I go? What shall I study?</P>

<p class="abzac">Once I read the advertisement in a local newspaper about the opportunity to study in the Netherlands and that was the breaking point in my decision making. I loved this idea not because of the going and living abroad, but because of the challenging difficulty to follow the course in English. The second reason was the NL itself that was full of extremes. Did you hear something about it? On the one hand, it had the best operating economy with the lowest inflation and unemployment level. On the other hand, soft drugs, prostitution, marriage between people of the same sex were legalized (polnyj bespredel). There were many pros and cons around it, but they leaded only to one result: I turned out to be here at the end of the summer 1998, the year I graduated the Lyceum.</P>

<p class="abzac">Many pages could be written about being and studying in the Netherlands because system is opposed to the one in Ukraine. I'll try to outline it and give the general impression.</P>

<p class="abzac"><H2>First of all, some facts about Netherlands and the Dutch which I consider to be interesting:</H2>
<UL>

	<LI>The area of the country is very small comparatively to other European countries 
	<BR>
“God created the earth but the Dutch made the Netherlands”: 20% of the country has been reclaimed from the sea and the process continues.
	<LI>Holland is a region and not a synonym for the Netherlands.
	<LI>The native language is Dutch. It has many similarities with German and English.
	<LI>One of the strongest economies in Europe
	<LI>Huge exports of food and gas.
	<LI>The population is above 15 million people.
	<LI>Number of bikes is 16 million. Every year 1 million bikes is stolen and sold over. I go to school by bike as well.
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Study</H2>
<p class="abzac">
Currently I am enrolled at the International Business School in the city of Groningen. There are two dimensions: Finance and Accounting, Marketing and International Management. I took the former because it has a lot to do with figures, calculations and computers.</P>

<p class="abzac">The duration is four years for BA degree and one or two years for Master degree. One year is divided I into two semesters. The semester consist of A and B block and after each of them there is exam period. All of the exams are written. During the first year I did 24 exams that were equally divided between 4 blocks. At the very beginning I had a sort of shock because I'd never had 6 exams from Monday to Thursday before.</P>

<p class="abzac">Sixth semester is set for the year abroad that gives opportunity to study in almost all countries in Europe, US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Russia (Moscow). My plan is to go to US for this semester in order to improve English and discover for myself a new continent.</P>

<p class="abzac">The seventh semester is internship in the company that will draw the insight of a real business world.
</P>

<p class="abzac">There is one substantial difference between the International Business School (IBS) and the Faculty of Economics at the University of Chernivtsy. The former focuses more on the practice and is close to the real world. At the faculty of Economics there are more theoretical subjects.</P>

<p class="abzac">In general, the studying is not very hard and one concept is true: keep doing!
</P>

<p class="abzac">I was at home two times since I came here and I miss my family very much. I'd be happy to find some new friends from Ukraine, especially those who have graduated Lyceum and keep in touch with them. Sometimes I can be very busy and it may take some days to reply but certainly I'll respond.</P>
