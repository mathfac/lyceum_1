Во многих (во всех) прогаммах обмена необходимым этапом конкурса является создание своего эссе. Это небольшое сочинение чаще всего и является основным критерием отбора. Для того чтобы справиться с этим заданием действительно круто, послушайте советы бывалого Алексея Андрусяка, который прислал нам их из Америки.</p>

<H3>1). How to get started?</H3>

<P class=abzac>
Think about your essay topic for a week. Write down ALL ideas that you will think of during this week and everything you want to include in your essay. I had a 2 sided paper full of ideas and notes before I started an essay. Then after a week sit down for 3-4-5-6 hours and write the entire essay without any interruptions. Just take your ideas and expand them. Write like 3-4-5 pages. Then leave it for a day. Come back and <FONT COLOR="blue"> delete all the ideas that you think other people will have in their papers.</FONT> You should get ~2 pages of printed text.</p>

<H3>2).What should the structure be?</H3>
<P class=abzac>
 Now pay attention to the structure:<BR><BR>

 1st paragraph - main idea, introduction<BR>
 2nd paragraph - body - prove your idea, include your background.<BR>
 3rd paragraph - conclusion - emphasize most important things from the body.



</p>
<P class=abzac>
 In the body try not to jump from one thing to another. Make it continuous. Show how each thing helped you. For example:"When I was in school #6 I won a regional olympiad in physics. That's why I entered Phys-Math Lyceum. In Lyceum I learnt about computers. That defined my major in University and helped my to get a job..."<BR>
 After this go back again and DELETE any ideas that do not show your way to your goal. For example if you won the all-Ukrainian poems competition, it might not be necessary to tell it in the essay, since it didn't help you to become a programmer.<BR>
<H3>3). What should you write about?</H3>
<P class=abzac>
 Well, it all depends on what kind of organization sponsors the program and what they want from their participants. My program seemed to expect strong motivation on why I can't get the education I want in Ukraine and how this 1 year in USA will help me to continue my education here in Ukraine. Your program might want something different.<BR>
Generally they want to hear:<BR>

1. Just a little bit of your background: don't forget to mention ANY diplomas that you have gotten - it always helps.<BR>
2. Why did you choose your major (and job, if applicable).<BR>
3. Why it is absolutely necessary for you to take part in this SPECIFIC competition for this SPECIFIC period of time. <FONT COLOR="blue">Don't sound desperate:</FONT> "Oh, if I don't win this program I will hate my life!". They don't like that. Try to show all your good sides and your interest in the program. Make THEM want YOU, not some other guy.<BR>
4. How this year (or two) in the USA will help you upon your returning to Ukraine. You should emphasize that you ARE going to come back, unless it is a non-government organization. If it is american-based commercial institution you should mention that there's a chance you might work for them later.<BR>
5. Think about it: all the applications will be the same: "I am the best. Take me to the US. I will work my ass off. I will be the smartest guy when I come back. I will make Ukraine a rich country." People just read a couple sentences and put such essays away. Try to make you paper original and interesting to read. The first sentence is the most important. If you have any original ideas - put it in the very beginning! This will make people want read your paper to find out what the hell you mean by that first sentence. <br>
I was applying for computer science (because they didn't have phisics), but I didn't have any diplomas or anything in computer science so my first sentence was: "In the modern world computers are not luxury - they are a necessity, just as computer scince isn't a study in and of itself". Then I stated how computers are used in any field of study today and how I wanted to learn computers to take physics problem solving onto a new level.<BR>
 I figured this will draw someone's attention and I think it worked! Only after this I started telling them how smart I am :-)<BR>
6. Это может прозвучать банально, but I would say that the most important thing (I think it is) -<FONT COLOR="blue"> Do not lie</FONT in your essay. If they will think you lied about something you will have no chances. I think we (lyceum students) have enough knowledge, diplomas, original ideas, experience, and self-esteem to be truthful and still win any competition.><BR>
Maybe the best evidence would be that I am here in the USA now, without Lying in my essay.
<BR>
<P class=abzac>
I really hope this will help you!!!<BR>
Use this information in any way you want. The only thing I ask in return is some feedback: if you use this and it helps you to win any competition, please tell me about it. Same way if you think some of the information here would hot help you win, tell me about it. All this is my own opinion.</p>
