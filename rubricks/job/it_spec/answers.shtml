<p class=abzac><a name="About myself"><strong>About myself </strong></a></p>

<p class=abzac>I graduated from Chernovtsy State University/Kiev National University, department of
CS. My major is computer, intellectual systems and networks. My BS thesis is Generating of
real time 3D images and MS thesis is internet server processing/ automation of public
payment reception in Chernovtsy region. I started to work as a programmer 5 years ago. I
participated in some large projects and in a number of smaller one’s during this period.
Most of them are currently in use and very successful. I am now working in National
company “Gas of Ukraine”/ Vuldi company. I’m responsible for database designing,
application development and system administration. I’m looking for a job where my skills
and experience will be realized. </p>
