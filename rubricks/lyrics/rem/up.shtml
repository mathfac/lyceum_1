Hey hey.<br>
<br>
I was hell.<br>
Sarcastic silver swell.<br>
That day it rained<br>
Tough spun. Hard won. No<br>
Ocean Flower aquarium<br>
Badlands. Give a hand.<br>
Honey dipt. Flim flam<br>
Hey hey. Hey hey.<br>
That cat can walk like a big bad man.<br>
<br>
So happy to show us<br>
I ate the lotus.<br>
Say haven't you noticed?<br>
I ate the lotus.<br>
<br>
Storefront window, I reflect.<br>
Just last week I was merely heck<br>
Tip the scale. I was hell<br>
Picked me up, the I fell.<br>
Who's this stranger? Crowbar spine<br>
...And I feel fine.<br>
Let it rain, rain, rain<br>
Bring my happy back again.<br>
<br>
So happy to show us<br>
I ate the lotus.<br>
Say haven't you noticed?<br>
I ate the lotus<br>
<br>
Let it rain, rain, rain<br>
Save me from myself again<br>
Wash away my ugly sins<br>
Opposing thumb, dorsal fin<br>
That monkey died for my grin<br>
Bring my happy back again<br>
Let it rain, rain, rain<br>
Bring my happy back again<br>

So happy to show us<br>

Now my suspicion's on the rise<br>
I have known, I have known your kind.<br>
Please don't talk, don't make me think<br>
Order up another drink<br>
Let me let imagination drive.<br>
<br>
Can't you see<br>
I need<br>
Nothing too deep.<br>
<br>
Imagination<br>
Come alive<br>
Suspicion<br>
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.<br>
<br>
Listen to the deviles in my ear.<br>
Tell me what, what I want to hear<br>
You're so funny, you're so fine.<br>
You're so perfect, you're so mine.<br>
That I nver had an opportunity<br>
To hide<br>
No I never had a chance<br>
<br>
Can't you see<br>
I need <br>
Nothing too deep.<br>
<br>
Imagination<br>
Come alive<br>
Suspicion<br>
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.<br>
<br>
Look into my eyes.<br>
They hypnotize.<br>
The lights, the drinks.<br>
Let the music carry you away<br>
<br>
My eyes are blurred<br>
My sights are limited<br>
Am I sensing a familiar twinge?<br>
<br>
Please don't speak<br>
Make me think<br>
It's all too deep<br>
<br>
Imagination<br>
Come alive<br>
Suspicion<br>
Step down, I'll dream tonight<br>
<br>
Step down, I'll dream<br>
You're so naked baby<br>
Carry me away<br>
Dream, dream<br>

You want to go out friday<br>
And you want to go forever.<br>
You know that it sounds childish<br>
That you've dreamt of alligators.<br>
You hope that we are with you <br>
And you hope you're recognized<br>
You want to go forever<br>
You see it in my eyes.<br>
I'm lost in the confusion<br>
And it doesn't seem to matter <br>
You really can't believe it<br>
And you hope it's getting better.<br>
<br>
You want to trust the doctors<br>
Their procedure is the best<br>
But the last try was a failure <br>
And the intern was a mess.<br>
And they did the same to Matthew<br>
And he bled 'til Sunday night<br>
They're saying don't be frightened<br>
But you're weakened by the sight of it <br>
You lock into a pattern<br>
And you know that it's the last ditch<br>
You're trying to see through it<br>
And it doesn't make sense<br>
But they're saying don't be frightened <br>
And they're killing alligators<br>
And they're hog tied<br>
And accepting of the struggle<br>
<br>
You want to trust religion<br>
And you know it's allegory <br>
But the people who are followers<br>
Have written their own stroy<br>
So you look up to the heavens<br>
And youhope that it's a spaceship<br>
And it's something from your childhood <br>
You're thining don't be frightened<br>
<br>
You want to climb the ladder<br>
You want to see forever<br>
You want to go out friday<br>
And you want to go forever. <br>
And you want to cross your dna<br>
To cross your dna with something reptile.<br>
And you're questioning the sceinces<br>
And questioning religion<br>
You're looking like an idiot <br>
And you no longer care.<br>
And you want to bridge the schism,<br>
A built-in mechanism to protect you.<br>
And you're looking for salvation<br>
And you're looking for deliverance <br>
You're looking like an idiot <br>
And you no longer care.<br>
You want to climb the ladder<br>
You want to see forever.<br>
You want to go out friday <br>
You want to go forever. <br>

A way to make you smile<br>

I read bad poetry<br>
Into your machine.<br>
I save your messages <br>
Just to hear your voice.<br>
You always listen carefully<br>
To awkward rhymes.<br>
You always say your name,<br>

At your most beautiful.<br>

They call me the apologist.<br>
And now that I'm at peak.<br>
You know at first it really hurt.<br>
We joke about these things.<br>
I've skirted all my differences<br>
But now I'm facing up.<br>
I wanted to apologize for everything I was. So<br>
I'm sorry, so sorry...<br>
<br>
Did you understand me right?<br>
The people here are good.<br>
They tell me what I should have done<br>
And offer what I could.<br>
I'm good, all is good<br>
All's well, no complaints.<br>
When I feel regret,<br>
I get down on my knees and pray<br>
I'm sorry, so sorry...<br>
<br>
I live a simple life<br>
Unfettered by complex sweets.<br>
You think this isn't me?<br>
Don't be weak.<br>
There I go.<br>
I'm so sorry.<br>
<br>
Thank you for being there for me.<br>
Thank you for listening, goodbye.<br>
I can forfeit selfishness<br>
I hope for you that you apply<br>
This happiness<br>
This peaceful ness<br>
I'm sorry, so sorry...<br>
<br>
I live a simple life<br>
Unfettered by complex sweets.<br>
You think this isn't me?<br>
That's no sweet.<br>
I'm so sorry<br>

If we're talking about love<br>
Then I have to tell you<br>
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.<br>
I've gotten lost before.<br>
I've woke up stone drunk<br>
Face down in the floor.<br>
<br>
Late afternoon, the house it hot.<br>
I started, I jumped up.<br>
Everyone hates a bore.<br>
Everybody hates a drunk.<br>
<br>
This may be a lit invention<br>
Professors muddled in their intent<br>
To try to rope in followers<br>
To float their malcontent.<br>
As for this reader,<br>
I'm already spent.<br>
<br>
Late afternoon, the house is hot.<br>
I started, I jumped up.<br>
Everyone hates a sad professor.<br>
I hate where I wound up.<br>
<br>
Dear readers, my apologies.<br>
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.<br>
Long silence presents the tragedies<br>
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.<br>
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.<br>
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.<br>
<br>
Late afternoon, the house is hot.<br>

You wanted a challenge that's calling you higher<br>
I landed on my feet by crawling<br>
I remember standing alone trying to forget you idling <br>
I hate to admit that that's my reference point<br>
But there it is you say you want me<br>
<br>
I'm what you found<br>
I'm upside down<br>
You're in the air<br>
You're in the air and I am breathing<br>
<br>
Brighten the stars the weather is lifting the heavens<br>
Love a love like this it's pulling you higher<br>
Twist it and trun this around it lights from within<br>
It dribbles your chin now brings a smile<br>
I'm lost again<br>
I'm lost again<br>
<br>
I'm what you found<br>
I'm upside down<br>
You're in the air<br>
You're in the air and I am breathing you<br>
<br>
I want the starts to know they've won if only to beguile <br>
The sky has opened up again in heaven reconciled<br>
I want you naked I want you wild<br>
I want the stars to know they win<br>
Give me that smile just give it me<br>
Just turn it on I'm lost again<br>
<br>
I'm what you found<br>
I'm upside down<br>
You're in the air<br>
I'm what you found<br>
I'm upside down<br>
You're in the air<br>

You're everwhere<br>
You're in the air and I am breathing you<br>

As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down<br>
These heavy notion creep around<br>
It makes me think<br>
Long ago I was brought into this life a little lamb<br>
A little lamb<br>
Courageous, stumbling<br>
Fearless was my middle name.<br>
But somewhere there I lost my way<br>
Everyone walks the same expecting me to step<br>
The narrowpath they've laid<br>
They claim to walk unafriad<br>
I'll be clumsy instead<br>
Hold my love me or leave me high.<br>
<br>
Say &quot;Keep withing the boundaries if you want to play.&quot;<br>
Say &quot;Contradiction only makes it harder.&quot;<br>
How can I be what I want to be?<br>
When all I want to do is strip away these stilled constraints<br>
And crush this charage shred this sad masquerade<br>
I don't need no persuading<br>
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up and walk unafraid<br>
I'll be clumsy instead <br>
Hold my love me or leave me high.<br>
<br>
If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go<br>
I just want to hold my head up high<br>
I don't care what I have to step over<br>
I'm prepared to look you in the eye<br>
Look me in the eye and if you see familiarity<br>
Then celebrate the contradiction<br>
Help me when I fall to walk unafraid<br>
I'll be clumsy instead<br>
Hold my love me or leave me high.<br>
Walk unafraid<br>
I'll be clumsy instead<br>
Hold my love me or leave me high.<br>

You've been so sad<br>
It makes me worry<br>
Why not smile?<br>
You've been sad for a while.<br>

You wake up in the morning<br>
And fall out of your bed<br>
Mean cats eat parakeets<br>
And this one's nearly dead.<br>
You dearly wish the wing would shift<br>
And greasy windows slide<br>
Open for the parakeet<br>
Who's colored bitter lime.<br>

Open the window<br>
And lift into your dreams<br>
Lately, baby<br>
You can barely breathe.<br>
<br>
A broken wrist<br>
An accident<br>
You know that something's wrong<br>
You fold the leavings of your past<br>
No one knows you've gone.<br>
The sunspot flares of the early<br>
Nineties light up your wings.<br>
And scan the shortwave radio<br>
It's tracking outer rings.<br>
<br>
The tectonic dispatcher shifts<br>
To smooth the ocean floor<br>
Of Brisbane's sunny shore.<br>
Where buddas tend to mending wrists<br>
Of eucalyptus fragrances<br>
And coriander seeds.<br>
<br>
You wake up in the morning<br>
To warm Pacific breeze<br>
Where mean cats chew on licorice<br>
And cannot climb the trees.<br>
<br>
Open the window<br>
And lift into a dream<br>
Baby, baby<br>
Baby starts to breathe </p>
